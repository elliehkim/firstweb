        <div class ="aboutme">
            <p>I am Hyein Kim also known as Ellie which is derived from my Catholic name, Elizabeth.
            I was born and raised in Gyeonggi Province in South Korea. I graduated from Hanyang University with a bachelor degree of English Culture and Langauge. I first came to New Zealand in 2016 for a new advanture and it was meant to be only for an year, but look! I am still here in NZ in 2021.</p>
            
            <p>I have 3 years of work experience in the hotel industry, 1.5 years in Food and Beverage and another 1.5 years in the Front Office. I enjoyed meeting new people from all around the world and providing a quality service to them. However, when the COVID broke out last year, I realized I want the secure job and a life-long term skill. As you know, tourism was the industry that had the most impact on.</p>

            <p>I started searching for other pathways and nothing really interested me except the programming. Therefore, I taught myself coding by taking online courses on Udemy and I found it intersting ever since. Now I would like to learn in-depth of the development world and to obtain a range of computer language skills. I believe this course would be the perfect opportunity for me to achieve my goals.</p>
